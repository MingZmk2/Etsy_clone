Logged-in users have the ability to add a new review for a product, choose the number of stars they want to give it, and edit their existing review and star rating. Non-logged-in users can view past reviews, but they are not able to create or modify reviews.

### Shopping Cart Item
When logged in, users can add items to their shopping cart from the product show page. They can select the desired quantity of the item, which will be reflected in the checkout page. The user can also modify the quantity in the checkout page and remove items from their cart as needed. The total price in the shopping cart is dynamically updated based on the selected quantities of each product.
